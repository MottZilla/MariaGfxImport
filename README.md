# MariaGfxImport

Builds Maria for PSX by extracting the assets from the PSP ISO image. 

Made possible by: https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/

Simple GUI application to build the MARIA.BIN and extract the required graphics assets from the PSP disc image. With a few clicks you can import Maria into your PSX disc image. This program doesn't contain the graphics for Maria, you must have the PSP version so they can be extracted. This is an alternative to building the decomp either normally or with the Docker image. 

Note: Import for Integrated Console Rando is for use with the Integrated Console Randomizer only as it stashes the MARIA.BIN elsewhere on the disc instead of replacing RIC.BIN

Basic Usage: The easiest way to use this would be to put this program in a folder with both a copy of your PS1 BIN+CUE files and your PSP ISO file and then run the program. You will be prompted to select your PSP file and then click Import GFX button. If Maria.BIN is successfully generated it will prompt you. If it does then Select your PS1 BIN file and then click Import Maria to import the data into your PS1 image.
