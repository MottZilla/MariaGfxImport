# MariaGfxImport
Builds Maria for PSX by extracting the assets from the PSP ISO image. 

Made possible by: https://github.com/Xeeynamo/sotn-decomp/wiki/

Simple GUI application to build the MARIA.BIN and extract the required graphics assets from the PSP disc image. With a few clicks you can import Maria into your PSX disc image. This program doesn't contain the graphics for Maria, you must have the PSP version so they can be extracted. This is an alternative to building the decomp either normally or with the Docker image. 

Note: Import for Integrated Console Rando is for use with the Integrated Console Randomizer only as it stashes the MARIA.BIN elsewhere on the disc instead of replacing RIC.BIN
